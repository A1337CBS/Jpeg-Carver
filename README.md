JpgScraper: An Advanced Carver for Baseline JPEG Files

This is a wrapper repository introducing tools used and proposed in following papers. Please cite properly.
* [jpeg-classifier-csharp-source](https://github.com/euzun/jpgscraper/tree/master/jpeg-classifier-csharp-source): A C# tool to discriminate encoded JPEG data from 993 different file data types. Coming soon!
* [jpeg-carver-csharp-source](https://github.com/euzun/jpgscraper/tree/master/jpeg-carver-csharp-source): Source code of JpgScraper C# toolbox.
* [jpeg-carver-csharp-exe](https://github.com/euzun/jpeg-carver-csharp): A C# toolbox to recover orphaned fragment (without any header information) data. Data is searched and recovered from given data file (100 times faster than Matlab implementation).
* [jpeg-carver-matlab](https://github.com/euzun/jpeg-carver-matlab): A Matlab toolbox to recover orphaned fragment (without any header information) data. Data is given as binary or hexadecimal string.
* [flickr-crawler](https://github.com/euzun/flickr-crawler): A java tool for crawling and downloading public images from Flickr by keywords, geo-locations etc.

* **NOTE**: csharp jpeg carving tool is currently only executable. It will be open-sourced soon.
